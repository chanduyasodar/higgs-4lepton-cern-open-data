# Interpretation of the Four-Lepton Invariant Mass Spectrum

The figure shows the reconstructed **four-lepton invariant mass** \( m_{4\ell} \) obtained from a real **CERN Open Data** dataset. Each data point corresponds to a proton–proton collision event with four reconstructed leptons (electrons and/or muons). The invariant mass is calculated from the combined four-momenta of the leptons:

\[
m_{4\ell} = \sqrt{\left( \sum_{i=1}^{4} E_i \right)^2 - \left| \sum_{i=1}^{4} \vec{p}_i \right|^2}
\]

This observable plays a crucial role in Higgs boson studies in the golden channel  
\( H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 4\ell \), as it provides good mass resolution and a clean experimental signature.

## What the Distribution Shows

The invariant mass spectrum exhibits a **smoothly falling distribution** across the full mass range. This behavior is characteristic of the dominant **Standard Model background**, primarily arising from the process:

\[
pp \rightarrow ZZ^{(*)} \rightarrow 4\ell
\]

Two vertical reference lines are shown on the plot:

- **Z boson mass (≈ 91 GeV):**  
  This line indicates the on-shell Z boson mass. In a four-lepton final state, a sharp peak is not expected at this value, since the observable corresponds to the combined mass of four leptons rather than a dilepton pair. Nevertheless, it provides a useful physical scale and marks the region where one Z boson becomes on-shell in \( ZZ^{(*)} \) production.

- **Higgs boson mass (≈ 125 GeV):**  
  This line indicates the expected position of a Higgs resonance decaying via  
  \( H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 4\ell \).

## No Obvious Resonant Peaks

No clear excess is observed near either of the reference masses. In particular:

- No visible Higgs peak is present near 125 GeV  
- The region around 91 GeV follows the expected smooth background behavior for a four-lepton invariant mass distribution

The absence of a visible Higgs peak is expected because the decay  
\( H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 4\ell \) has a very small branching ratio, and the available CERN Open Data sample is limited. Any Higgs contribution is therefore much smaller than the dominant \( ZZ \rightarrow 4\ell \) background and cannot be identified by visual inspection alone.

## Physical Interpretation

The measured four-lepton invariant mass spectrum is consistent with:

- Standard Model expectations  
- A background-dominated sample of \( ZZ^{(*)} \rightarrow 4\ell \) events  

The lack of a statistically significant Higgs signal is a consequence of the limited dataset size rather than a deficiency in the analysis.

## Summary

- The four-lepton invariant mass was reconstructed from real CERN Open Data  
- The spectrum is dominated by the \( ZZ \rightarrow 4\ell \) background  
- Reference lines indicate the Z boson (91 GeV) and Higgs boson (125 GeV) masses  
- No statistically significant excess is observed near either mass  
- The results are consistent with Standard Model predictions within limited statistics
