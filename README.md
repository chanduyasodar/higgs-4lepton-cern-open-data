This repository contains a complete analysis of real CERN Open Data focused on the Higgs boson golden channel (H → ZZ* → 4ℓ). The project reconstructs the four-lepton invariant mass spectrum from reconstructed lepton four-momenta and performs a background-dominated statistical interpretation consistent with LHC experimental methodology.

The analysis demonstrates correct handling of null results, background modeling, and confidence-level interpretation, rather than attempting an artificial Higgs discovery.
